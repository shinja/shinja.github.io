# Development Process with Git

### Using branch for developing new features
Git branch helps you to diverge from the main line of development and develop your own functions without inter-influencing with main line.

How to create a new branch?

```
$ git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME
Switched to a new branch 'NEW_BRANCH_NAME'
```

Git branch gives you a snapshot of the current branch code base. And, it's almost cost nothing, you can easily and feel free to create a new branch for developing.

I strongly recommend to create a new branch from some code base while developing new features.

### Update new feature branch with "git rebase"
The great about git is it's a distributed source version control and allow many people develop new features locally. However, that might happened when I am developing features and some people push their new features to git server, how could I update the source properly? There

### Using "git rebase" with local branches only
I always using `$ git rebase ` when I checkout my local new feature branch and checkout the `master` branch to merge with the rebased "new feature" branch. Here is my steps of git commands:

```
# update master branch
master)$ git pull
master)$ git check new_feature

#update new_feature code base with master branch.
#In this step, code conflict might hapened, try to resolve the conflict, and using `$ git rebase --continue` to continue the rebase process.
new_feature)$ git rebase master
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
...

# update the master branch and push to server.
new_feature)$ git checkout master
master)$ git merge new_feature
master)$ git push
```

Never using `$ git rebase` with the source code tracked on the server. It will mess commits up very easily when you work with other people on the same branch.

# Some Git Tips

### Reset the "origin" remote branch
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1519006/how-do-you-create-a-remote-git-branch

```
# remove original tracked upstream
$ remote remove origin
# add new remote repository
$ remote add origin(or other remote name) [URL]
# Track the upstream branch
$ git push -u origin [branch name]
```

### push to remote specific branch

```
$git push <remote-name> <local-branch-name>:<remote-branch-name>
```
